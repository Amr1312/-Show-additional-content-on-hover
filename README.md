# -Show-additional-content-on-hover
Creates a card that displays additional content on hover.
Use overflow: hidden on the card to hide elements that overflow vertically.
Use the :hover and :focus-within pseudo-class selectors to change the card's styling if the element is hovered, focused or any of its descendants are focused.
Set transition: 0.3s ease all to create a transition effect on hover/focus.
